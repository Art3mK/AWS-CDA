    - long term log retention
        ```
        You can use CloudWatch Logs to store your log data indefinitely in highly durable and cost effective storage without worrying about hard drives running out of space. The CloudWatch Logs Agent makes it easy to quickly move both rotated and non rotated log files off of a host and into the log service. You can then access the raw log event data when you need it.
