# Elastic Compute Cloud

VM in Cloud.

### EC2 options
- on demand, by the hour (or by the second, linux only)
    * low cost adn flexibility without up-front payments
    * app with short term, spiky workloads
    * developing/testing apps
- reserved (1-3 year contracts, платить заранее)
    * steady state or predictable usage
    * app requires reserved capacity
    * upfront payments to reduce costs
        * Standard RI's (up to 75% off on demand)
        * Convertible RI's (up to 54% off on demand)
            * ability to change attributes of the RI
            * `>=` instance size
        * scheduled RI's (recurring load)
- spot instances
    * apps with flexible start and end times
    * apps that are only feasible at very low compute prices
    * urgent computing needs for large amounts of additional capacity
    * you terminate - you pay for the hour
    * AWS terminates - you get the hour it was terminated in for free
- dedicated hosts - physical EC2 servers (For licenses)
    * regulatory requirements
    * licensing without multi-tenancy support or cloud deployments
    * available on-demand (hourly)
    * 70% off with reserved instance

## EBS

- EBS are placed in a specific AZ, where they are automatically replicated. (Not to different AZ, but between SANs)
- cannot mount to multiple instances

Bootable:
- Magentic standard (bootable)
- GP2
- IO1

### Volume types

- GP2, general purpose SSD
    * 3 IOPS per GB with up to 10k IOPS, burst up to 3k IOPS
- Provisioned IOPS SSD (IO1)
    * I/O intensive
    * if you need >10k IOPS
    * provision up to 20k IOPS
- Throughput optimized HDD (ST1)
    * big data
    * data warehouses
    * Log processing
    * sequential data
    * cannot be a boot volume
- Cold HDD (SC1)
    * low cost
    * file server
    * cannot be a boot volume
- Magnetic (Standard)
    * bootable
    * lowest cost
